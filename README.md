Project 100 Belgians (100 Unequal People for the global name if expended to other countries)

**INTRO**

A website that illustrates inequality by using 100 fictional Belgians as an example.
It would generate 100 Belgian profiles based on real income + wealth data, then extrapolate their life situations using ChatGPT and real-world data when available.
 Ideas for comparison points:
- Holidays (once a year, twice a year, where?)
- Buying a smartphone
- Going to restaurants
- How easy it is to go to a Taylor Swift concert (impossible vs “on a whim”)
- Homeownership (owner of 1 home, 2 homes, or more)


Job types: politician, self-employed, secondary-school teacher, Walloon Region civil servant, etc.


For people who want to, they can fill in a questionnaire and see which profile is closest to them. A chart shows where they fall in the hierarchy. The goal is to highlight the bias where people think they’re “middle class” when they are actually rich—and vice versa.
Two axes/lines: Income and Assets. Everyone sits somewhere on that scale, and you can sort profiles by it.
Tags to filter the “bucket” of Belgians:
Language


Retired vs working


Ancestry, etc.
